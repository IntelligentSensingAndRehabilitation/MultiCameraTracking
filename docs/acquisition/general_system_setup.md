# General System Setup and Requirements

## Minimum requirements

These may vary depending on the number of cameras used. The following specs are for up to 8-10 cameras and using a laptop for acquisition.

Note: The acquisition system has been developed and tested on Linux. We have not tested it on Windows, Linux VM, etc.

- 32GB RAM
- CPU with at least 20 logical processors
- i9 processor preferred
- Thunderbolt port

## Setup

1. Install Linux on the acquisition computer (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)
2. Ensure you are running on the 6.1.0-1036 kernel version and pin it so it does not auto-update
